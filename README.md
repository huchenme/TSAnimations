Inspired by [15DaysofAnimationsinSwift](https://github.com/larrynatalicio/15DaysofAnimationsinSwift), [Sam Lu](https://twitter.com/samvlu)'s [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html) and [Allen Wang](https://twitter.com/creativewang)â€™s [30 Days of Swift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift) projects, I decided dedicate 15 days to creating animations in Swift.
